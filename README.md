marioKartFX - now marioKartMediaPlayer was a project done in freshmen year as a project. My partner and I worked with JavaFX to create a visual menu modeling a previous programming
assignment from this class. We took it a step further by adding a media player- nothing within the scope of our project. We did this to 'simulate' mario kart races during the 
time trials to make it feel like more of a 'real' mario kart tornument and not just a problem.
